"""Anonymous, device/browser-based memory for this public app - built
2026-08-31 per Koro's own confirmed design: most visitors never create a
real account (see patient_store.py's own signup flow, which requires an
email and password), so this gives every anonymous visitor real, permanent,
personal memory too - keyed to a device-generated ID the frontend sends
with every /ask call, no email or password required.

Mirrors the same real, tested design already proven in Koro Global Hub's
own core/apprentice_memory.py (device_id + person_name compound identity,
because anyone can share a phone) - reimplemented standalone here since
this backend deliberately never imports the private Hub's code (same
"public apps are self-contained" rule as everything else in this repo).
Reuses patient_store.py's own local sqlite file and Fernet/keyring
encryption rather than inventing a second storage/encryption scheme in the
same small app.

REAL, HARD DISTINCTION - same as the Hub's own module:
  - Nothing is ever deleted or expired from device_memory. Every exchange,
    forever, for every device, is a permanent record.
  - recall()'s max_turns is a prompt-injection cap only - how much of that
    permanent history fits in one real LLM call. It never deletes or hides
    data from the store itself.

DEVICE + NAME DISAMBIGUATION: person_name="" is the valid "no name given
yet" bucket - every new device starts here, and it's the permanent
fallback if a person never gives a name at all. When a device offers a
name that isn't already known for it, that's treated as a genuinely
separate person sharing the device - its own empty memory thread, never
blended with anyone else who has used that device.

# informations in their own obsidians" and "they should never get lost

# never read back into a prompt. The bounded, recency-capped SQLite
# recall above (recall(), max_turns) stays the only thing that actually
# feeds an answer, so this markdown file can grow forever, for years,
# without any risk of an apprentice "getting lost" in its own history the
